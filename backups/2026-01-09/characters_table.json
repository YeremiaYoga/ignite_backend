She never really knew her mother but knows she was associated with the rich aristocrats in Maple. Imani's mother was forced to abandon her to save face since Imani was a half elf drow.\\n<br>      Imani's father, Troy, was much kinder than her mother and tried to care for her, but since he was a consultant for the Adventurer Guild, this wasn't an easy task for him. So when Imani was ten, Troy brought her to an orphanage run by the holy order.\\n<br>\\n<br>Chapter Two\\n<br>Awaking to unknown innate magic at the Holy Order Orphanage \\n<br>\\n<br>          Imani's time at this orphanage was relatively good. She was tasked with mundane work like cleaning, cooking and prep, and helping take care of the younger children there, which she really enjoyed. Imani would also attend classes to learn how to read and write.\\n<br>\\n<br>          This kind of lifestyle would change when Imani turned 12, when she awoke to innate magic she was unable to control. The investigation of this incident gained the interest of Amelia in the Delstainvia branch of the Holy Order and arranged a meeting with Imani and her father, Troy. Amelia's deal was bringing Imani into the Holy Order and training her as a soldier as she sees real potential in her and Troy agreed. \\n<br>\\n<br>Chapter Three\\n<br>The Mentorship of Amilee and a love for research. \\n<br>\\n<br>          Imani was assigned a caretaker named Amilee who would train her on how to maintain control of her. Amilee was this branch of the Holy Order Arcana R&amp;D expert and had a wealth of magical knowledge and items. On top of teaching Imani on how to control her magic, she also taught her about the arcana and alchemy.Imani would spend most of time with Amilee, learning and studying under her, gaining an interest in magic and alchemy. \\n<br>\\n<br>         This kind of dynamic was something Imani was lacking her entire life. Imani's and Amilee's relationship was one closer to family than student and teacher. With a very lose connection to her actual family, Amilee was basically the mother figure for the majority of her life. At the age of 19, Imani would be assigned her first assignment and her nightmare was beginning. \\n<br>(Start of Coj)&nbsp;<br></p>\"",

All of his memories felt scrambled, so the best way to remember was to write down his memories on an old tethered Notebook that he stumbled across so he can note the events of his life.</p><p>While writing in his notebook one evening, He heard a giggle, they had asked him what he had. Not really thinking clearly, He told the person whom he can’t see, like the face themselves are hazy, that He’s just trying to remember what he’s doing. A Smile slowly forms as they said that they’ll Borrow it, taking it from Necrons hands as he then felt lost without it.</p><p><br></p><h1><span style=\\\"font-weight: normal;\\\"><i>Only One Memory Remains</i></span></h1><p><br></p><p>During one of the bright days of his “trials” a Figure walked up to him. He has been getting better at seeing past the haze of peoples faces and began recognizing some, though he struggled remembering them long term, with his notebook taken away, he was sent as a “proxy” with another individual to help aid them and to keep track of them with the purple cloak.</p><p><br></p><p>He was promised his notebook back if he does so, and after that moment. He fixated on watching this individual and every move, action they make. Though he cannot remember what they had said, he sees him talking to other individuals as he stays in silence. Mask on his face to conceal whatever Identity he might have, he watches in silence. As they eventually left, The person that he so carefully watched told him that He needs to not stare so intently, Necron asked why. The person stated that “I’ve been watched long enough by things I cannot control”.</p><p><br></p><p>Necron Reflected, Maybe He’s been through enough things long enough he cannot control. What if.. His memories were just being tempered with, No person has this poor of a memory. Maybe, Maybe he can leave with his notebook, maybe then he can truly remember who he is as a person.</p><p><br></p><h1><span style=\\\"font-weight: normal;\\\"><i>Guided Without Sight</i></span></h1><p><br></p><p>He had received a note, an Invitation perhaps. An invitation to join something beyond where he currently is. Call it a job, he thought. Though he's unaware how he got the letter, maybe by Bird, handed it to him by a stranger. He cannot recall the details. But the letter said to go to “Orange Coral” for Orientation. He however, cannot tell which direction is where. But with a sense of maybe finding out who he is he wished to set out.</p><p>The place he was in was found fairly empty, like something should be here but isn’t, He felt lost. Almost like he was so dependent on guidance that he doesn't know how to walk without a helping hand. Making his way to the door he heard a voice, a gentle soft spoken voice. She had asked him where he was going, Necron responded that “he wants to find himself”.</p><p>The figure, obscured by the bright sunlight, looked up at Necron; he could faintly see the smallest trace of a smile perhaps, not the typical smile he saw previously with the strange individual, but a kind one.</p><p>“Let me Help you then..” Spoke the figure.</p><p>A soft hand moved to Necron as he felt like the world brightened up a thousand times, mind no longer foggy though confused but with a strong resolve of purpose, Remembering what he was sent out to do Leaves to go to Orange Coral After the Figure told him simply to go straight ahead and he'll find his destination.</p>\"",

Though at first just being a doll like many others, this would date the start of a new friendship. Slowly <b>coming to life due to Flandre's magical prowess</b>.</span></p></p><p><h4 style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><span style=\\\"font-family: inherit;\\\">Chapter I: Memories</span></h4><p style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\"><span style=\\\"font-family: inherit;\\\">At some point Lilly <b>began having some form of consciousness</b>, being aware of her surroundings and able to create and hold onto memories. <b>Flandre would animate and cast spells through her</b>, with every strand of magic weaving itself into Lilly further cementing her presence in this world. Lilly would come to learn how to process and connect information together, understanding who and what she is and what she meant to <b>this young girl who loved her</b>.</span></p></p><p>Lilly <b>would always be found with Flandre</b>, be it during her magical studies or <b>performing in theater plays</b>. Though she had <b>no autonomy or voice of her own</b>, she still found it fulfilling to be at Flandre's side.</p><p><h4 style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><span style=\\\"font-family: inherit;\\\">Chapter II: Love</span></h4><p style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\"><span style=\\\"font-family: inherit;\\\">Time would go on and Lilly would come to understand the emotions of the young Mademoiselle, <b>seeing her slowly but surely fall into despair</b>. Having no control all Lilly could do was watch her suffer, not understanding how anyone could look at Flandre with such dismay and disapproval. She loved her so why couldn't they? <b>Yet no one would come to her aid, not even the gods</b>.</span></p></p><p>Something Changed within Lilly, <b>promising Flandre</b> that if she could do something about it. <b>She'd make sure that they would never hurt her again</b>. Lilly had <b>learned not just how to Love</b> and care for her best friend, <b>but to despise, to Hate</b> this world which would let the <b>Wicked go unpunished</b></p><p><h4 style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><span style=\\\"font-family: inherit;\\\">Chapter III: Hate</span></h4><p style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\"><span style=\\\"font-family: inherit;\\\">On <b>flandre's 12th birthday</b>, as Lilly would watch her get dressed up and ready to present herself to those who only showed up to appease her family. Lilly's dreams of one day being able to protect her would be shattered as she watched <b>Flandre get taken right in front of her</b>. Why they were here, what they wanted, and who they were didn't matter to Lilly.... they took her best friend right in front of her, and that would not stand.</span></p></p><p>Lilly then gained control of her body and the power that dwelled within her using it to take down anyone who stood in her way, whether they were a member of the abductors or a person running for their lives. No one ever tried to save Flandre from the pain that she faced, so to Lilly <b>they all deserved the same fate</b>. Unfortunately for her the manor was not able to withstand the power she unleashed, crumbling around her and leaving her trapped under the rubble for an <b>unknown amount of time</b>.</p><h4 style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\">Chapter IV: A Promise yet unkept</h4><p style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">Lilly would awake to the faces of <b>Willow and a hag who went by Granny Rags</b>, two people who happened upon the ruins of the manor. Lilly would be told by the hag a basic level of understanding of what she is. A being of <b>Tampered Memoria</b>, remnants of Flandre's magic weaving itself into her. She would learn that to be reunited with her friend it would lead her down the <b>same path that Willow had</b>, and she was tasked by Granny Rags to catch up with her and give her an artifact that would allow Willow to return home. </p><p>Thus she left to fulfil her promise that she made to her friend, however late it may be.</p>\"",

Though her childhood was simple, she carried a natural gift for reading people — the tone of a voice, the hesitation in a gesture, the truths hidden between words. While she loved her family deeply, she always sensed that her small village could not contain the person she was meant to become.</p>\\n<h1><strong data-start=\\\"771\\\" data-end=\\\"813\\\">Chapter II — The City and Independence</strong></h1>\\n<p data-start=\\\"814\\\" data-end=\\\"1307\\\">When she reached adulthood, Astrid made the difficult choice to leave home and travel to the city in search of her own future. The transition was overwhelming, but she adapted quickly, taking odd jobs and learning the rhythms of urban life. She built connections with merchants, guards, travelers, and workers, slowly weaving herself into the city’s living structure. Each challenge sharpened her ambition, turning her into a capable, confident young woman determined to shape her own destiny.</p>\\n<h1><strong data-start=\\\"1317\\\" data-end=\\\"1357\\\">Chapter III — The Information Broker</strong></h1>\\n<p data-start=\\\"1358\\\" data-end=\\\"1909\\\">As she matured, Astrid discovered her true calling: information. She had a rare talent for uncovering rumors, interpreting secrets, and seeing connections others missed. Over time, she became a discreet information broker, trusted by both lawful authorities and those living outside the law’s reach. She handled messages, tracked whispers, and traded valuable knowledge — always with caution, always with purpose. She never sought power, but her reputation grew quietly; people across the city learned that Astrid could find answers no one else could.</p>\\n<h1><strong data-start=\\\"1919\\\" data-end=\\\"1971\\\">Chapter IV — The Meeting That Changed Everything</strong></h1>\\n<p data-start=\\\"1972\\\" data-end=\\\"2928\\\">It was during this period that Astrid crossed paths with Kivaari — a man the world had already condemned. Framed by a noble and betrayed by his own father, Kivaari left prison with a ruined name and little choice but to survive on the city’s fringes. Though not truly a criminal, desperation pushed him into small, gray-area jobs that kept him alive. When Astrid found him behind a workshop, exhausted and defeated, she didn’t see the outlaw everyone else feared. She saw a man wronged and abandoned. She listened, believed his story, and offered something no one else had: food, shelter, honest work, and a chance at redemption. In time, their paths intertwined into a quiet partnership — Astrid gathering information and Kivaari managing discreet tasks she couldn’t risk. Through her guidance, he walked the narrow line between shadow and redemption, held steady by the one person who refused to let him fall into the life he had been falsely accused of.</p>\"",

Her movements are quiet and deliberate, never rushed, as if she’s always thinking two steps ahead.

His father demanded discipline, obedience, and silence, and Kivaari grew up believing loyalty and family were unbreakable. Though he lived modestly, he carried a quiet determination to create a stable, honest life for himself, unaware of the betrayal that would one day tear his world apart.</p>\\n<h1 data-start=\\\"1235\\\" data-end=\\\"1283\\\"><strong data-start=\\\"1240\\\" data-end=\\\"1281\\\">Chapter II — The Framing and Betrayal</strong></h1>\\n<p data-start=\\\"1284\\\" data-end=\\\"1781\\\">As a young adult, Kivaari was falsely accused of a crime committed by a powerful noble who needed a scapegoat to protect their own reputation. When the moment came for someone to defend him, his father stayed silent — choosing political safety and social standing over his own son. The verdict was swift. Kivaari was imprisoned, branded a criminal, and abandoned by the man whose word could have saved him. His trust shattered, he served his sentence alone, carrying both injustice and heartbreak.</p>\\n<h1 data-start=\\\"1788\\\" data-end=\\\"1837\\\"><strong data-start=\\\"1793\\\" data-end=\\\"1835\\\">Chapter III — The Outlaw Who Isn’t One</strong></h1>\\n<p data-start=\\\"1838\\\" data-end=\\\"2282\\\">Released to a world that already hated him, Kivaari struggled to find work, shelter, or purpose. Society saw him as an outlaw, forcing him into the city’s shadows just to survive. Though he refused to harm innocents or fully embrace the criminal identity forced upon him, he learned to operate in gray areas — discreet work, quiet jobs, survival-driven tasks. He became resourceful, sharp, and cautious, navigating an underworld he never chose.</p>\\n<h1 data-start=\\\"2289\\\" data-end=\\\"2327\\\"><strong data-start=\\\"2294\\\" data-end=\\\"2325\\\">Chapter IV — Meeting Astrid</strong></h1>\\n<p data-start=\\\"2328\\\" data-end=\\\"2925\\\">On one of his lowest days, hungry and exhausted, Kivaari crossed paths with Astrid. Where others saw a criminal, she saw a man broken by injustice. She listened to him, believed him, and offered him work and a chance to reclaim dignity. Through her, he found someone who trusted him when no one else would. Over time, their partnership grew — Astrid gathering information, Kivaari handling delicate or dangerous tasks she couldn’t risk. She became the anchor that kept him from sinking into the darkness he’d been pushed toward, reminding him that he deserved more than the label society gave him.</p>\"",

This theory, use the knowledge he found that God's power of creating demi-plane and the magical phenomena of demi-plane creation which occurred due to Primordial Magical Energy. So he believe to creation of demi-plane can be done, through the Arcane Art if one can tab beyond the so called mortal limit of 6th circle magic which he himself during that time was unable to crack. According to his calculation the amount of Arcane Energy needed to make a somewhat stable Demi-Plane is equal to 8th circle magic. This would be impossible or risky if done with Arcane fueled material due to Entropy Decay Syndrome.</p><p>Although he created forward a theory, that if someone could control the Primordial energy, they might able to control it long enough to create a Demi-Plane. Which he could calculate only can be done by the many Will of Humanity or Memories Emotion. Even so the needed amount is so many that it can only be done without anyone's control, or if so then the need of a powerful machine which absorb many Memories that was created around, which still take more than a life time naturally, but he believe that if someone does try to control the situation, they might able to succeed, but these kind of matters can only done with heavy toll in human sufferance.</p><p>And so according to many Genius or even H<span style=\\\"font-family: inherit;\\\">errscher, that this theory cannot be done unless someone wishes to throw away their moral, or their understanding of limit.

    "backstory": "\"<u><b>Chapter 1 - \\\"Birth\\\"</b></u><p>Unbeknownst to Esther and those around her, Esther is not only an Aasimar, but is the seed for a young<b> Beholder</b>, which is planted deep within her.</p><p>Esther is the product of a beholder's dream - eventually, given enough time and external pressures, that<i>&nbsp;'seed'</i> with sprout and trigger a slow transformation into a beholder.</p><p>Though, this version of Esther in <i>Tales of Daseron</i>, has had <b>fairly few and relatively mild signs</b> of being a baby beholder leading up to the campaign.</p><p>However, I will leave to the <b>Discretion of the DM</b> when and how further stages of the transformation process will be activated in Esther, and the things already in the story that may cause them.</p><p><u><b>Chapter 2 - Orphanage and Adoption</b></u></p><p>The Beholder's dream had placed Esther in <b>Delstainvia</b>. She was picked up as a baby by some local farmers, cared by them for 3 years, then was passed on to an orphanage nearby, where she was given her name by the caretaker.</p><p>Luckily, at age 6, a wandering scholar and wizard - <b>Barnabas Rhodes</b> - was looking for candidates for a new apprentice and per chance had chosen her.</p><p><u><b>Chapter 3 - Tutelage and Youth</b></u></p><p>The Wizard Barbanas took the young Esther under her wing, <b>adopting her as his own</b>. He trained her in the arts of the arcane and gave her an informal education. Though, Barabas was <b>fairly relaxed</b> as wizard masters go, so she had a lot of time to herself and her left to her own devices. She often was left around town and the villages nearby, to play and associate with various villager kids. Esther gained a bit of a reputation as a roughhouser - sometimes getting to fights with other kids.</p><p>Nevertheless, she had a positive and exciting childhood into early adulthood.</p><p>Barnabus's residence was in southern Alvavia, overlooking the Misted Coast. Some years Esther spent there, and sometimes the two of them would travel together on the road looking for magic supplies and various errands that Barnabas was running. She was his apprentice afterall.</p><p>Still, she was left to her own devices often, and got mixed in with different crowds and sub-cultural groups, picked up more then a few acquaintances and friends along the way. However, Esther wanted to be different from the average person, and not all her friends were seen as having the most positive influence on her. Many of her friends were seen as 'delinquents' or 'punks'. Nevertheless, Esther did her part to fit in with those around her</p><p><u>C<b>hapter 4 - Working Woman</b></u></p><p>By her early 20's, it was agreed by both Barnabas and Esther, that she \\\"spread her wings and fly\\\" to have a job and some place in society. She was welcome back anytime she back she needed a place to stay at Barnabas's place, of course, Esther was practically her daughter at this point.</p><p>Her first job was actually working at some mines, near the <b>Midland Peaks.</b> She was tasked with helping this one guy who was working on some e<b>xperimental, arcane machines</b> for mine work. She did that for a few months, but the project got mysteriously sabotaged, and eventually ran out of funding for not being reliable. Esther moved on and stayed back with Barnabas for some time.</p><p>Then, on another gig, she worked on the <b>arcane railroad</b> in Alvavia, got a commission on a train as an engineer. She loved it and did it for about 2 years. She had a boyfriend around this time, but one evening out, he got a glimpse of an uneasy presence emanating from Esther. He got so spooked that her left her, never speaking with her again. Esther was demoralized during this period, and left her job shortly afterwards. She head back to Barnabas's residence.</p><p>C<b><u>hapter 5 - Signs of Slipping</u></b></p><p>Back at her childhood home with Barnabas, Esther wasn't feeling the best at this point in her life. She got involved with friends who weren't always the most positive influence of her. She got involved with the <b>alternative music scene, often going </b>to loud parties and music festivals with friends. And most conquentially, she also turned to substances - drugs and alcohol.</p><p>So much so - she met this one producer of narcotics - and <b>began selling drugs.</b></p><p>One day, she <b>got caught by authoritie</b>s selling drugs.</p><p>The guards dragged her to Barnabas's home where she was staying, good old Barnabas was able to clear the matter up.</p><p>Still, he was furious at her. She needed a place to get back on track with her life.</p><p>Barbanas told Esther to pack her things&nbsp;</p><p><b><u>Chapter 6 - Trouble on the Road to the Academy</u></b></p><p>Esther was scheduled to arrive on the first day at the Academy.</p><p>Along the way to the academy, she got <b>ambushed by bandits</b> along with the caravan - her cart with other survivors got spooked and headed off road into the desert. This incident occured near th<b>e Dragon's Jaws</b> in the Southern Desert approaching <b>Archfield.</b></p><p>They were lost for a time. But Esther was able to cleverly come up magic that helped then find the road, and where they needed to go. She finally made it to Archfield and the Academy..&nbsp;</p>\"",

Naturally during a war the most desperate need for those talents were those fighting in wars.  The war camps drew in entertainers like flies to honey, lots of people that had nothing to do in between battles and nothing else to spend their wages on.  She had heard stories from people that had come from all walks of life and seen more than enough sadness form these soldiers to last her a lifetime.  One night while she was filling up her wineskin she picked out a particularly despondent, and strikingly handsome that looked like he was one push away from breaking down completely.  She usually didn't involve herself personally in thigs like this despite having a good eye for how people feel, something about this man was different.  she silently approached him and offered to share a drink with him if he would share what happened to him.  after some light persuasion he started talking, and couldn't stop, she was convinced he would share his entire life hour by hour until he fell asleep on her lap just as the sun rose.  She felt like she could make this work.\"",

He has a daughter now... who is no longer waiting.</p><p><span style=\\\"font-family: inherit;\\\">Elandra's search leads her to a remote watchpost where she encounters a calm, blue-eyed warden—</span><strong style=\\\"font-family: inherit;\\\">her half‑sister</strong><span style=\\\"font-family: inherit;\\\">, though she doesn't know it at first. Elandra asks carefully, voice trembling despite her resolve:</span></p><p><strong>“Do you know Nocitis… my father?”</strong></p><p>The warden studies her, then nods. “He left this morning. A false hydra has surfaced in the eastern canyons. He went to face it before it spreads.”</p><p>Before Elandra can respond, the air shimmers—her mother’s old mentor and guardian steps through the veil of illusion.</p><p><strong>“Where is my husband?”</strong> she demands, worry and power woven into every word.</p><p>The warden bows her head. “On the hunt. And he should have returned by now.”</p><p>A shared silence settles—fear, hope, and unanswered questions all tightening in their chests.</p><p>They board a waiting <strong>flying ship</strong>, its wings of arcane light unfolding like a great silver bird. As the vessel rises into the clouds, Elandra grips the railing, the wind in her hair, her heart pounding.</p><p>When she finds him, she won’t cry.</p><p>She will look into his tired eyes and ask only one thing:\\n<strong>“Why did you leave me behind?”</strong></p><p>Whether his answer will break her, or set her free—only the stars know.</p><h3 data-start=\\\"126\\\" data-end=\\\"167\\\"><br></h3><h1><strong data-start=\\\"130\\\" data-end=\\\"167\\\">Epilogue: The Coffee Shop Meeting</strong></h1><p data-start=\\\"169\\\" data-end=\\\"398\\\">The flying ship docked near a quiet overlook, where the wind carried the scent of roasted beans and distant rainfall. Inside a small coffee shop tucked between towers of old stone and humming engines, four figures sat in silence.</p><p data-start=\\\"400\\\" data-end=\\\"648\\\">Elandra sipped slowly from her cup, her gaze locked on the man seated across from her. Her mother, Isabella, rested one hand gently on the table, the other clasped around her own mug. Beside her sat the Warden, still in light armor, alert but calm.</p><p data-start=\\\"650\\\" data-end=\\\"805\\\">Nocitis sat with them, the years carved into his face like etchings on weathered stone.

Inside, they waited—letting the silence stitch something fragile back together.</p><h1><strong>Epilogue: Nocitis’ Last Moment</strong></h1><p>Before speaking a word, Nocitis placed three books on the table—each worn by years and burdened with purpose. The first, bound in pale vellum, held the key to saving him. He entrusted it to his daughter, knowing she would one day pass it to the one who needed it most. The second, marked with a darkened spine, contained the truth of what and how to kill him; he set it aside for his cousin and the rightful bearer of that knowledge. The third, wrapped in old cloth, held the story of his own bloodline—his father, his sister, and his mother—all tied to the Titanfallen Isles, the place where light and shadow first shaped his lineage. This one he gave to his sister, the Warden, with a steady hand.</p><p>As the weight of his choices settled, exhaustion crept in. His vision blurred. His breath shortened. When he rose from his seat, a thin line of blood slipped from his nose, staining the floor. The room tilted, the world dimmed, and before anyone could reach him, Nocitis collapsed. she also hates tano in genreal&nbsp;</p>\"",

    "main_personality": "She is a curious and imaginative individual who thrives on discovery and transformation. With a mind attuned to both the mysteries of the world and the magic within it, she explores new ideas, forgotten ruins, and untold truths. She is introspective yet bold, driven by a desire to reshape what is broken and uncover what is hidden. Although she never knew her father, she holds a quiet longing to discover his identity—believing the answers may be found in the forgotten corners of the world she’s drawn to.",
    "detailed_personality": [
      "Restless Curiosity and Inner Void: Elandra constantly seeks answers—especially about her father, Nocitis. Her desire to understand why he disappeared shapes many of her decisions. This yearning creates a quiet emotional ache beneath her composed exterior. She’s inquisitive, deeply reflective, and always asking questions that others are afraid to ask, particularly about family, legacy, and loss.",
      "Calm, Yet Fierce When Cornered:While she speaks softly and listens more than she talks, Elandra inherited her mother’s sharp intuition and her father’s blade-ready instincts. She’s not easily rattled, but when pushed emotionally or threatened physically, she reacts with unexpected strength—almost as if she’s channeling someone else’s fire. Her calmness is a mask that hides an intense spirit of survival and conviction.",
      "Wounded Seeker of Closure: Elandra carries a deep emotional conflict between acceptance and persistence. Trained in magic by her mother and gifted with her father’s charm and swordsmanship, she possesses a natural talent for both diplomacy and dueling. Yet beneath her composed exterior is a girl who grew up wondering why she was never enough for her father to return.  She masks her pain behind curiosity, exploring not just the world but the cracks in her own story. This quiet obsession drives her to uncover truths others might leave buried. Her emotional patterns lean toward delayed reactions—she processes deeply but often alone. She internalizes guilt that doesn’t belong to her and has a habit of assuming emotional responsibility for the silence others left behind."

Without proper parents and no sign of who their parents are. She was raised to be a church girl who was an awfully kind and peaceful soul.<br>She had always taken reading seriously, despite being in a church which follows Lord death, she takes it upon herself to learn about each and every god, demi-god to her best capabilities.<br>Within a small field that once was barren with dead grass and lifeless trees a Priestess had watched Lute tend to the barren land. Within a few months when the priestess decided to check on the barren land. She came across Lute dancing and singing with a field filled with flowers and fluorescent grass that glistens in the sunlight.<br><br></span><span class=\\\"c3\\\">Chapter 2: Reverence in Motion<br><br></span><span class=\\\"c2\\\">Within the church, during one of the times of prayer, Lute has grown to be a sort of idol amongst not just the church but to the locals as this singer who isn&#39;t quite a priestess but also a wonderful singer whom people actually began to adore and showed up for church despite them only being there for the performances. <br><br>Most of the Priests and Priestess&rsquo;s did not like that the Church is being less used as a church and more like a stage. Whispers had long grown among the clergy that the faithful came for her voice more than the sermons.<br>They had planned something to poison Lute with her own flowers with some being poisonous, though during the scandal Lute had found out about it by overhearing.<br><br>Quietly within the night she prayed to Lord Death for forgiveness that she&rsquo;s leaving the church and to set out. Once packing her belongings along with her hand-crafted Lute that she made using one of the dead trees she used to make the beautiful garden, she sets out. Giving out a small Prayer to both Tryarha Mithso for good luck and Limia to help guide her throughout the night on her long walks.<br><br><br></span><span class=\\\"c3\\\">Chapter 3: Petalwaltz<br><br></span><span class=\\\"c2\\\">Throughout her travels, she had come across the Intelegentsia guild, she was naturally talented with learning information. She in fact was Alarmingly talented with how magic works along with how the intricacies of how the weave works. Though was often side-tracked with her passion of creating music and poetry with constant prayers to different gods with various tasks she does.<br> <br>They however found uses for her, she can be used to travel and give Letters if magic was not an option. Though during one of the travels Lute found that there was one odd letter that she had rehearsed to remember as she always speaks the letter and burns it so nobody but her knows about what the letter said. It however left her disturbed with the Intelegentsia guild, she left in the middle of her mission from the guild as it went against her beliefs baring to knowledge of the letter. With this being the first letter that felt like a sin to speak aloud.<br><br>After she had left she pursued music where she found major success amongst the crowd even among dark times, she was a beacon that people looked to for happiness with her kind smile and positive outlook.<br><br>Though with the kindness of one&#39;s dance, there must be a contrasting force to even the brightest beacons right at their doorstep.<br><br></span><span class=\\\"c3\\\">Chapter 4: One Who Walks a Half-Step Behind&mdash;and Asks Me to Dance </span></p><p class=\\\"c4 c5\\\"><span class=\\\"c2 c6\\\"></span></p><p class=\\\"c4\\\"><span class=\\\"c2\\\">During her trip to Orange Coral which was meant to be a show for many people to come and see. Within the show it had been going wonderfully, throughout the night sky there were lights going on with wondrous color. Though she had noticed there being more guards out than normal. Perhaps for her own protection, Security had been tightened after recent stalking attempts considering the popularity is the assumption she went under.<br>Though during her time on stage, tragedy struck with portals opening in the sky and monsters rained down. During the chaos that unfolded she prayed to </span><span class=\\\"c0\\\">Barkakit</span><span class=\\\"c2\\\">&nbsp;to try and figure out what was going on. But before she could finish the prayer her shoulder was grabbed with a lady named </span><span class=\\\"c0\\\">Ina</span><span class=\\\"c2\\\">&nbsp;telling her to move it and to get out of here. Lute seeing the people panicked and her wishing to help refused, with a determined look told her that &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t leave them behind&rdquo;<br><br>Ina seeing the look on Lute and not having the luxury of time folded as she said to help get as many civilians out. With the both working together managed to do so. Both talking along the way of their brief introductions, Ina was part of the crowds that she saw for her show. At one point they had to part ways with promises of potentially seeing each other again sometime, Lute leaving saw the chaos of what had happened, and vows to help as many individuals as she can without killing and redeem as many people as possible.<br><br></span><span class=\\\"c3\\\">Chapter 5: Scattered Petals<br><br></span><span class=\\\"c6 c2\\\">In her sleep a memory is formed, though she cannot dream she felt like she had seen this before..she cannot see within whatever realm she&#39;s in, Feelings of flowers are on her eyes and her face, neck, even arms. She can feel like she is being held by something, either warm or cold with a voice speaking to her in sadness as she lays there weak. Without her knowledge she began speaking. &ldquo;______&hellip;wont..you..smile&hellip;For me?&rdquo;...sniffling can be heard from the male &ldquo;Lute&hellip;I..&rdquo; Her mouth would begin moving on her own again saying &ldquo;Please&hellip;Wont..Last&hellip;.Long&rdquo;<br><br>The male would compose themselves slowly as tears drip onto her face &ldquo;yeah.. I&rsquo;m smiling Sweetheart&hellip;Im..Smiling&rdquo;. Lute could feel her mouth open, muttering words that even she cannot understand. &ldquo;Hm..? Can you&hellip;Say that again..I didnt&hellip;Quite catch that&hellip;&rdquo;<br><br>&hellip;</span></p></body></html></div>\"",

Though centuries had passed, people whispered that his blood had not gone silent—that one day, a descendant would emerge carrying both his face and his curse.<br>It was there that <strong data-start=\\\"858\\\" data-end=\\\"880\\\">Noctis Shadowbrook</strong> was born.<br>From the moment he opened his eyes, it was clear he carried something ancient within him. His reflection seemed older than his years, and the aura surrounding him unsettled even those with steady hearts. Elders often paused as they looked at him, murmuring that some legacies refused to fade.<br>Sometimes, when Noctis passed a still pond at twilight, he imagined the surface rippled not from wind, but from a memory not his own. “Maybe his magic is still watching,” he wondered. “Maybe it never left.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<hr data-start=\\\"1394\\\" data-end=\\\"1397\\\">\\n<h1><strong data-start=\\\"1402\\\" data-end=\\\"1449\\\">Chapter II: The Echo of His Father’s Magic</strong></h1>\\n<p data-start=\\\"1452\\\" data-end=\\\"1492\\\">Noctis grew quietly, but not peacefully.</p>\\n<p data-start=\\\"1494\\\" data-end=\\\"1664\\\">As he aged, strange visions began to surface—<br data-start=\\\"1539\\\" data-end=\\\"1542\\\">\\nshards of battles he had never fought,<br data-start=\\\"1580\\\" data-end=\\\"1583\\\">\\nvictories he had never earned,<br data-start=\\\"1613\\\" data-end=\\\"1616\\\">\\nand emotions far too heavy for someone so young.</p>\\n<p data-start=\\\"1666\\\" data-end=\\\"1740\\\">These were not dreams.<br data-start=\\\"1688\\\" data-end=\\\"1691\\\">\\nThey were fragments of Lord Draken’s final spell.</p>\\n<p data-start=\\\"1742\\\" data-end=\\\"1934\\\">Before his defeat, the tyrant had woven an enchantment meant to bind pieces of his soul, memories, and hunger into the blood of his last descendant.

Survival is a duty.” — Covenant creed\n\nPurpose & Philosophy\n\nThe Gloam Covenant was not formed to protect a race. It was formed to control outcomes. Where the Crescent Veil believes in refuge, unity, and preservation, the Gloam Covenant believes in intervention, manipulation, and prevention at any cost. They act before threats become wars—often in ways no one will ever praise. They do not ask who deserves saving. They ask what must be done.\n\nWhy It Exists (and Why It Hates Her)\n\nHalf of the Covenant’s members were once part of the Crescent Veil. They left for one reason: They believe Noctis’s sister is a liability. Some see her as too idealistic. Others see her as dangerous, reckless, or destined to fracture the Veil from within. A few believe her presence will eventually expose the Veil to annihilation. Nocitis does not openly share their hatred—but he does not stop them either. The Covenant exists because he knows the world will not be saved by purity alone.\n\nMembership\n\nThe Gloam Covenant is not race-bound. Humans, elves, dhampirs, tieflings, shadar-kai, and others serve side by side. Loyalty is earned through action, not blood.\n\nInternal Divide\n\nThe Veilborn — former Crescent Veil agents who abandoned its ideals\nThe Unbound — outsiders drawn to the Covenant’s ruthless clarity\n\nThis divide is tense but functional.\n\nStructure\n\nThe Arbiter — Nocitis Shadowbrook\nSilent authority. Final word. Rarely overrules—more often watches.\n\nBlack Keys\nStrategists and planners. They decide who must be removed, bribed, or broken.\n\nGloam Hands\nOperatives. Assassins, saboteurs, interrogators, retrieval agents.\n\nLedger Keepers\nArchivists who record debts, secrets, favors, and sins. Nothing is erased—only delayed.\n\nMethods\n\nAssassination (clean or cruel, as needed)\nMemory alteration or erasure\nPolitical manipulation\nForced disappearances\nFalse flag operations\nBlackmail through truth—not lies\n\nThey do not protect innocents directly. They remove what threatens them.",

One of these personalities created by the archfey themselves often leads to dark thoughts that dox perceives is from Barkakit which when it either takes or is given control gives Dox a near uncontrollable will for chaos, whether this be petty crime or a strange bloodlust. One of these events led to a well known hero (who is the son of a famous general during the war) in the continent (name pending depending if you want to name them for story or me) hunting Dox down. Dox doesn’t remember what exactly happened when confronted by the hero, all they know is that they “woke up” next to their corpse covered in the hero's blood and when they saw a reflection of themselves saw that they had morphed into the hero's form and donned the mask. Shortly after he was confronted by a kenku who was accompanying the hero who witnessed the event, decided to take advantage of the situation threatening to report him unless he helped him make money.</span></p></li></ul><br><ul style=\\\"padding-inline-start: 48px;\\\"><li dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"list-style-type: disc; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline; text-wrap-mode: nowrap;\\\" aria-level=\\\"1\\\"><p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" style=\\\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\\\" role=\\\"presentation\\\"><span style=\\\"font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline; text-wrap-mode: wrap;\\\">&nbsp;This new life came with unexpected positives for Dox, as he continuously met those who “they” had protected and saved the hero's personality started to take hold as it gave Dox a true sense of belonging giving him a drive to try to help protect and rid the world of evil.

They hold a strange mix of innocence and hunger — the gaze of someone who sees more than she should. Her lips are faintly tinted with the same pink hue as her hair, giving her an otherworldly vibrancy against her pale complexion.\n\nDelicate pointed ears peek through her hair, betraying her changeling nature. A dark, high-collared strap wraps around her neck, contrasting sharply with her light skin — both practical restraint and statement.

For generations, the Beniko family served as guardians of a mysterious relic, its purpose long obscured by time yet protected with absolute devotion.<br data-start=\\\"808\\\" data-end=\\\"811\\\">\\nRaised in the cold halls of <strong data-start=\\\"839\\\" data-end=\\\"854\\\">Beniko Keep</strong>, high in the northern mountains, Eugen’s childhood was shaped by rigorous training, ancient expectations, and stories of honor passed from one generation to the next.<br data-start=\\\"1021\\\" data-end=\\\"1024\\\">\\nEven then, there was something different about him—a quiet depth, a gaze that lingered on things unseen, as if he sensed a world beneath the world.</p>\\n<h1 data-start=\\\"1178\\\" data-end=\\\"1221\\\"><strong data-start=\\\"1180\\\" data-end=\\\"1219\\\">Chapter II — Awakening to the Weave</strong></h1>\\n<p data-start=\\\"1222\\\" data-end=\\\"2137\\\">While his kin devoted themselves to perfecting martial skill, Eugen felt drawn toward something greater: <strong data-start=\\\"1327\\\" data-end=\\\"1340\\\">the Weave</strong>, the invisible tapestry of arcane energy that underlies all creation.<br data-start=\\\"1410\\\" data-end=\\\"1413\\\">\\nIn hidden chambers beneath the keep, he meditated with the ancestral sword placed before him. Over time, he learned to hear the faint, living hum of the Weave threading through the stones, the air, and his own pulse.<br data-start=\\\"1629\\\" data-end=\\\"1632\\\">\\nThrough focus and stillness, he discovered that the Weave did not merely surround him—it <em data-start=\\\"1721\\\" data-end=\\\"1732\\\">responded</em> to him. It sharpened his senses, strengthened his body, and allowed arcane energy to flow through him as naturally as breath.<br data-start=\\\"1858\\\" data-end=\\\"1861\\\">\\nThis bond grew stronger with each passing year, culminating in a rare talent few warriors ever touched: <strong data-start=\\\"1965\\\" data-end=\\\"1988\\\">telekinetic control</strong>. Objects shifted at the edge of his perception. Attacks slowed when aimed at him. The battlefield itself bent subtly under the pressure of his will.</p>\\n<p data-start=\\\"2139\\\" data-end=\\\"2296\\\">No Beniko knight had ever displayed such affinity for the Weave.<br data-start=\\\"2203\\\" data-end=\\\"2206\\\">\\nNo record suggested such a gift was possible.<br data-start=\\\"2251\\\" data-end=\\\"2254\\\">\\nThe Weave had chosen <em data-start=\\\"2275\\\" data-end=\\\"2280\\\">him</em>, and him alone.</p>\\n<h1 data-start=\\\"2303\\\" data-end=\\\"2344\\\"><strong data-start=\\\"2305\\\" data-end=\\\"2342\\\">Chapter III — Eugen and the Weave</strong></h1>\\n<p data-start=\\\"2345\\\" data-end=\\\"2897\\\">Eugen’s connection to the Weave defied explanation even among the elders. They could sense magic only faintly—yet he interacted with it as effortlessly as drawing breath.<br data-start=\\\"2515\\\" data-end=\\\"2518\\\">\\nThere was no ritual, no technique, no ancient doctrine guiding him. What he accomplished was not something taught; it was something awakened.<br data-start=\\\"2659\\\" data-end=\\\"2662\\\">\\nHe touched the Weave instinctively, gently, as though it were an extension of his own mind. Through this bond, he learned to steady falling objects, redirect incoming blows, and influence the world with subtle shifts of arcane force.</p>\\n<p data-start=\\\"2899\\\" data-end=\\\"3079\\\">The elders soon realized a truth they kept unspoken:<br data-start=\\\"2951\\\" data-end=\\\"2954\\\">\\n<strong data-start=\\\"2954\\\" data-end=\\\"3012\\\">no one in House Beniko could replicate what Eugen did.</strong><br data-start=\\\"3012\\\" data-end=\\\"3015\\\">\\nWhatever destiny the Weave hinted at, it belonged solely to him.</p>\\n<h1 data-start=\\\"3086\\\" data-end=\\\"3134\\\"><strong data-start=\\\"3088\\\" data-end=\\\"3132\\\">Chapter IV — The Relic of Unknown Origin</strong></h1>\\n<p data-start=\\\"3135\\\" data-end=\\\"3788\\\">Central to the Beniko oath was a relic: a <strong data-start=\\\"3177\\\" data-end=\\\"3196\\\">mysterious hilt</strong>, immaculate despite its age. Crafted of mithral, enchanted obsidian, elegant gold tracery, and an adamantine grip, the object radiated faint but undeniable arcane presence.<br data-start=\\\"3369\\\" data-end=\\\"3372\\\">\\nTo others, the relic remained silent and cold.<br data-start=\\\"3418\\\" data-end=\\\"3421\\\">\\nBut whenever Eugen neared it, the Weave stirred—subtle ripples, like a breath being held.<br data-start=\\\"3510\\\" data-end=\\\"3513\\\">\\nThe hilt did nothing, yet somehow it <em data-start=\\\"3550\\\" data-end=\\\"3559\\\">noticed</em> him.<br data-start=\\\"3564\\\" data-end=\\\"3567\\\">\\nIts nature remained hidden, its purpose lost in the fog of forgotten centuries, but Eugen sensed that the Weave and the relic were entwined. And he suspected that the answers lay not within the keep, but beyond its walls.</p>\\n<h1 data-start=\\\"3795\\\" data-end=\\\"3844\\\"><strong data-start=\\\"3797\\\" data-end=\\\"3842\\\">Chapter V — The Call Beyond the Mountains</strong></h1>\\n<p data-start=\\\"3845\\\" data-end=\\\"4338\\\">When he came of age, restlessness pushed against Eugen’s heart. The elders’ silence regarding the relic’s origin only strengthened his resolve. The Weave whispered of a road untraveled, a truth waiting beyond the northern cliffs.<br data-start=\\\"4074\\\" data-end=\\\"4077\\\">\\nHe donned his armor, took up the Beniko sword, and secured the relic-hilt at his side.<br data-start=\\\"4163\\\" data-end=\\\"4166\\\">\\nWith a final bow to his family, he descended the mountain path.<br data-start=\\\"4229\\\" data-end=\\\"4232\\\">\\nNot as a knight fulfilling duty—but as a seeker compelled by something greater than heritage or tradition.</p>\\n<h1 data-start=\\\"4345\\\" data-end=\\\"4396\\\"><strong data-start=\\\"4347\\\" data-end=\\\"4394\\\">Chapter VI — Trials of the Wandering Knight</strong></h1>\\n<p data-start=\\\"4397\\\" data-end=\\\"5068\\\">Eugen’s journey took him across kingdoms and wildlands, where civilization dissolved into ancient mysteries. He ventured through enchanted forests, studied forgotten ruins, and crossed blades with foes drawn to the relic’s quiet aura.<br data-start=\\\"4631\\\" data-end=\\\"4634\\\">\\nIn every trial, his bond with the Weave deepened.<br data-start=\\\"4683\\\" data-end=\\\"4686\\\">\\nHe learned to blend swordsmanship with arcane force, shaping the Weave into precise bursts of power, guiding blades with invisible currents, and defending himself through instinctive telekinetic interference.<br data-start=\\\"4894\\\" data-end=\\\"4897\\\">\\nScholars saw him and faltered. Mages sensed him and grew wary. Some sought to mentor him; others tried to claim the relic.<br data-start=\\\"5019\\\" data-end=\\\"5022\\\">\\nBut none understood what he carried—not truly.</p>\\n<h1 data-start=\\\"5075\\\" data-end=\\\"5130\\\"><strong data-start=\\\"5077\\\" data-end=\\\"5128\\\">Chapter VII — The Hilt, the Legacy, the Destiny</strong></h1>\\n<p data-start=\\\"5131\\\" data-end=\\\"5746\\\">Through all his travels, the relic-hilt remained pristine, untouched by time, bound by potential yet unrealized.<br data-start=\\\"5243\\\" data-end=\\\"5246\\\">\\nEugen felt it growing more attuned to him with each new awakening of the Weave. There were nights when the hilt felt almost warm—nights when the Weave pulsed faintly around it, as if preparing for something long delayed.<br data-start=\\\"5466\\\" data-end=\\\"5469\\\">\\nHe came to understand:<br data-start=\\\"5491\\\" data-end=\\\"5494\\\">\\nHis family had not guarded a mere artifact.<br data-start=\\\"5537\\\" data-end=\\\"5540\\\">\\nThey had guarded a destiny—one that had waited generations to find <em data-start=\\\"5607\\\" data-end=\\\"5612\\\">him</em>.<br data-start=\\\"5613\\\" data-end=\\\"5616\\\">\\nWhatever the relic truly was—weapon, key, or conduit—it would reveal itself in time.<br data-start=\\\"5700\\\" data-end=\\\"5703\\\">\\nAnd when it did, the Weave would guide him.</p>\"",

The Aslan’s innovations have benefited the economy of Mondral, and the Armed Forces of the Mondralian Army. Ziost, the supposed heir of the Aslan Arsenal, trained not only in the art of fighting, but also in the art of forge creation. \\n<br>\\n<br><h3>Takeover\\n</h3>\\n<br>However, The Yunaka Foundation, an organization that controls most of Mondral’s economy, still had a desire to grow by absorbing other organizations to expand its power. When they sought the Aslan Arsenal under their control, Their method? A hostile takeover—by blood. One fateful night, under the shroud of a crimson moon, the Foundation’s enforcers stormed the Aslan estate. Ziost fought desperately alongside his family, but they were outnumbered and outmatched. He watched, helpless, as his kin were slaughtered, his home burned, and his legacy that he was to inherit -stolen.\\n<br>\\n<br><h3>Coincidence or Fate\\n</h3>\\tBleeding out among the ruins of his lineage, Ziost felt the weight of finality—his story was ending before it had truly begun. But in that moment of despair, the world seemed to freeze. Time itself stilled. A voice, ancient yet melodic, echoed through the void:\\n<br>\\\"You do not wish to die. And I do not wish to see your time undone.\\\"\\n<br>Before him stood Talia, Guardian of the Flow of Time, an ethereal entity draped in silken veils that shimmered with cascading stars. Perhaps Ziost had called out to her in his desperation—or perhaps she had already foreseen his plight and reached out first.\\n<br>I will restore you, Ziost of the Aslan House. But know this—time does not give freely. It demands purpose.\\\"\\n<br>She rewove the strands of his fate, pulling him from the precipice of death. Yet, in exchange, Ziost was bound to Talia’s Bidding. His body healed, but the scars of that night were more than physical. Now a warlock, his power ebbed and flowed like the tides of history—sometimes allowing him glimpses of what was, other times nudging events toward what could be albeit only a possibility.\\n<br>Now armed with the powers of his patron Talia,  lives his life how he can while following Talia’s words&nbsp;<br></p>\"",

Hands always dusted with dye, hair smelling faintly of lavender and smoke. Her parents taught her the art of weaving, but also its patience. “A good cloth,” her mother would say, “isn’t made by force. It listens. It waits.” Elyra believed her mother was talking about more than fabric.</p><p data-start=\\\"517\\\" data-end=\\\"937\\\"><br></p><p data-start=\\\"1155\\\" data-end=\\\"1274\\\">Sometimes, as she worked the loom, she’d pause to watch how a single misplaced thread could change the whole pattern. “Maybe people are like that too,” she thought. “Each one changes the world, even just a little.”</p><p data-start=\\\"1155\\\" data-end=\\\"1274\\\"><br></p><h1><strong data-start=\\\"1479\\\" data-end=\\\"1516\\\">Chapter II : The Pathstrider of Talia</strong></h1><p data-start=\\\"1155\\\" data-end=\\\"1274\\\">The Edenria family kept a small shrine above their hearth. A polished silver mirror, framed with brass. It was a humble altar to <span data-start=\\\"1739\\\" data-end=\\\"1760\\\" style=\\\"\\\">Talia, the Weaver</span>, the goddess who bound past, present, and future through her eternal loom. </p><p data-start=\\\"1155\\\" data-end=\\\"1274\\\">“If every life is a thread,” she often wondered, “then maybe Talia doesn’t just weave us forward and protect us. maybe She listens to us, too.... Although she is the Silent Goddess, hard for me to tell haha” Which she laugh nervously to.</p><p data-start=\\\"1155\\\" data-end=\\\"1274\\\">\\r\\n</p><p data-start=\\\"2205\\\" data-end=\\\"2402\\\">On still evenings whenever she is alone, the candle burned low, Elyra sometimes thought she saw her reflection blink a moment too late, or smile just before she did. It frightened her once. Then it comforted her now. She doesn't know why it does, but it makes her fell safe.</p><p data-start=\\\"2205\\\" data-end=\\\"2402\\\"><br></p><h1><strong data-start=\\\"2413\\\" data-end=\\\"2450\\\">Chapter III : The Plagues Which Pull Her Threads</strong></h1><p data-start=\\\"2452\\\" data-end=\\\"2723\\\">The peace of Takao rarely changed, which is until several travelers from the East came. They spoke of <strong data-start=\\\"2530\\\" data-end=\\\"2558\\\">a strange magical plague</strong> spreading through Delstanvia’s borderlands: spells failing, reflections moving on their own, and people losing whole days of memory as if time itself had skipped.</p><p data-start=\\\"1155\\\" data-end=\\\"1274\\\">\\r\\n</p><p data-start=\\\"2725\\\" data-end=\\\"2943\\\">Most in the village dismissed it as distant rumor as there are only a couple of folks who bestow this tale. But when Elyra prayed that night, the flame before Talia’s mirror bent sideways, and for an instant, she saw the reflection of her own hands, unraveling into light. “Something is off... This is not just a simple rumor... This is something else,” she whispered.</p><p data-start=\\\"2725\\\" data-end=\\\"2943\\\"><br></p><p data-start=\\\"2725\\\" data-end=\\\"2943\\\">No voice answered her, but she felt it. A gentle pull, like the tug of a thread asking to be followed. That quiet, patient feeling she’d always known at the loom was now inside her, urging her to move.</p><p data-start=\\\"2725\\\" data-end=\\\"2943\\\"><br></p><h1><strong data-start=\\\"3205\\\" data-end=\\\"3242\\\">Chapter IV : The Reason She Walks</strong></h1><p data-start=\\\"3244\\\" data-end=\\\"3474\\\">Elyra left Takao at dawn. The sky was pale and the river mist low. She carried only what she could: a travel cloak, her prayer mirror wrapped in cloth, a spool of blue silk tied around her wrist, and her mother’s quiet blessing. “If the world is fraying,” Liebhaberin told her, “then mend it where you can, my love. Even a single stitch can save a pattern.”</p><p data-start=\\\"3244\\\" data-end=\\\"3474\\\"><br></p><p data-start=\\\"3610\\\" data-end=\\\"3664\\\">Her father, Astaria, pressed a hand to her shoulder. “Please stay safe...” he said softly although trying to act tough as he doesn't want to show weakness towards his own daughter in this uncertain time, but he knew there is high chance she might get hurt if she head East. </p><p data-start=\\\"3610\\\" data-end=\\\"3664\\\"><br></p><p data-start=\\\"3610\\\" data-end=\\\"3664\\\">She then walk forward towards the direction East heading towards a meeting place where she may meet with someone who have been searching for Adventurer to help out the situation of the <b>Magical Plague</b> which many dismiss, but she wish to give it a try.</p>\\r\\n<p data-start=\\\"2725\\\" data-end=\\\"2943\\\">Most in the village dismissed it as distant rumor as there are only a couple of folks who bestow this tale.

Her family were never known to her even by the caregivers within the Monastery.<br>Suni however had a gift, Or a curse; that being the curse that whenever she sees an individual in physical or mental pain. She experiences the very same pain if she gazes upon them when it occurs. She had grown used to wearing a blindfold over her eyes to avoid such occurrences from happening. But she had learned to be sympathetic and empathetic to each and every person she came across.<br><br></span><h1><span class=\\\"c3\\\">Chapter 2- Blindsight Beneath the Veil</span></h1></p><p class=\\\"c1\\\"><span class=\\\"c0\\\"><br>Within the frosty streets of Everwinter, Suni walked at a brisk pace, confidence carried in every step. She had made her presence known as both a preacher and advocate for people’s rights. No matter one’s background or sins, she believed wrongdoing was not born of evil, but of paths darkened by neglect and absence of guidance.<br><br>She grew accustomed to the places she traveled to. In a tavern she always heard old and new voices doing different yet wonderful things. What bothered her was one individual, one man who always sat alone doing the same things. Over and over like an illness waiting to destroy him on the inside-out.<br>Suni took note of the individual, and day after day she hears the same man in the tavern ordering the same thing. Day after day he would always mutter while being consumed at his own work. She grew curious of the man, feeling the same mental strain he felt even threw her blindfolded.<br></span></p><p class=\\\"c1\\\"><span>She decides to break the cycle by sitting at his table.<br><br></span><h1><span class=\\\"c3\\\">Chapter 3- Where Warmth Took Root</span></h1><span class=\\\"c0\\\"><br>Leaning against the wall, Suni watched her firstborn, Janus, play outside with her husband, Hector. One hand rested against her side as she endured a quiet, familiar pain. Her second child would be born soon—and she knew something was wrong. Still, she chose not to trouble the happiness she had found.</span></p><p class=\\\"c2\\\"><span class=\\\"c0\\\">With a soft smile, she stepped into the warmth of her family’s embrace. It was a life she wished she could remain within forever. Behind her blindfold, her eyes ached—not from sight, but from longing—as she offered a silent prayer to a god known only to her, begging that her child be born healthy.</span></p><p class=\\\"c2\\\"><span class=\\\"c0\\\">For now, she would spend every moment she could ensuring her family knew joy. That she had mattered.</span></p><p class=\\\"c2\\\"><span>She removed her blindfold. For the first time in a long while, she looked upon them fully—Hector smiling, Janus running toward her, laughter unbroken.</span></p></div>\"",

His belief became clear that formal education is a gateway to gain access to greater knowledge, even forbidden knowledge.<br><br>Within a dark corner of the Library a Lady emerges out as she’s watching the young man’s curious obsession of whatever he is reading, Questions were asked out of curiosity, with a back and forth questioning. Hector was offered something he never thought he’d expect; A position, to be an assistant.

Her earliest memories were not of toys or games, but of whispered debates, layered wards humming through marble halls, and elders who taught that power was not something wielded—it was something contained.</p><p>From a young age, Sylvi learned to listen more than she spoke. Strategy, she was told, began with silence.</p><p>It was during a diplomatic convergence between realms that she first met Sir Caelum Mortimer Renatus. He arrived not as a conqueror, but as a commander who understood restraint. Where others postured, he observed. Where others threatened, he calculated.</p><p>Sylvi noticed immediately.</p><p>Their first conversation was not romantic. It was logistical. Fleet movement. Defensive lines. What could be saved if the worst came to pass?</p><p>By the end of the evening, Sylvi realized something rare:<br>This was someone who understood the cost of command.</p><p>By the end of the year, she chose to stand beside him.</p><p>They would go on to have three children, long before the world would test what that choice truly meant.</p><h1>Chapter II: The Arcane Shield</h1><p>Sylvi’s education never ended.</p><p>She mastered defensive wards, counter-spells, and battlefield control, learning not how to destroy armies—but how to deny them victory. While Caelum shaped the Azure Fleet through leadership and resolve, Sylvi shaped the unseen layers that kept it alive.</p><p>To the fleet, she became known as The Arcane Shield.<br>To enemies, she was something worse: a wall they could not understand.</p><p>She advised Caelum in councils and in private, mapping political pressure as carefully as troop movement. She did not raise her voice. She did not issue threats.</p><p>She explained the consequences.</p><h1>Chapter III: The War Beneath the War</h1><p>When conflict with the Galion escalated, Sylvi's role deepened.</p><p>She served as a spy, tactician, and arcane analyst, unraveling enemy plans before they could take form. Illusions were countered. Supply lines vanished. Rituals failed without explanation.</p><p>Many believed the Renatus family was simply fortunate.</p><p>Sylvi knew better.</p><p>Wars were not won on battlefields alone. They were won in preparation, in denial, and in silence.</p><h1>Chapter IV: The Elders' Ultimatum</h1><p>When the Elders issued their command, Sylvi did not oppose them with defiance.</p><p>She tried to reason.</p><p>She offered a compromise.<br>She proposed alternatives.<br>She argued for delay tactics, for strategy instead of sacrifice.</p><p>They listened.</p><p>Then they gave her one final warning:</p><p>“Your loyalty is noted.<br>Your hesitation is not.<br>Disobey, and the daughter of your husband’s brother dies first.”</p><p>In that moment, Sylvi understood the truth.</p><p>This was not governance.<br>This was control.</p><p>She did not scream.<br>She did not weep.</p><p>She returned to Caelum with a calm expression and a sharpened resolve, knowing that from this point on, every choice would cost something precious.</p><h1>Chapter V: The Reason She Stands</h1><p>Sylvi remains at Caelum's side—not because she is commanded to, but because she chooses to be.</p><p>She stands between her family and forces that believe obedience matters more than love. Between her children and a future decided by threats whispered behind closed doors.</p><p>She is no hero of songs.</p><p>She is a strategist, a mother, a shield.</p><p>And she will decide—for herself—what lines will never be crossed.</p>\"",

He was a restless child who was one filled with energy and liveliness, his father Hector was always around and tended to his joyful antics but never to the extent as his brother has.<br><br>He and his brother Janus are inseparable, he would have always got himself into trouble and more often than not would get caught. But before punishment could be dealt, his brother would come to save him, he idolized him for that.<br><br></span><h1><span class=\\\"c0\\\">Chapter 2: Too Young of Age</span></h1><span class=\\\"c1\\\"><br>Grunting and exertion from Garmal can be heard but does so with a smile. He had been collecting Copper and Silver with laborious job’s in secret to get a sweet treat for himself and his brother. His sore little body hurt from hauling whatever people needed him to move, but in the end; It would be worth it for moments of respite.<br>He called his brother from up on the hill with both Ice creams in hand waiting for his brother. After seeing his brothers look even if he offered him the Ice cream he looked worried. <br><br>A short talk explains that their father will leave them for a trip while seeing the distress on Janus’s face. He wanted his brother to feel Validated. He gave him a hug, words of encouragement and promises.<br><br></span><h1><span class=\\\"c0\\\">Chapter 3: Bound by the Same Dream</span></h1><span class=\\\"c1 c4\\\"><br>Floating weightless, Garmal wished to scream and thrash about. He couldn’t see and felt lost.<br>What felt like hours, he saw a glowing light with a small waterfall. Wishing to know where he is, he climbed up higher reaching a peak. He sees himself, or what can only be described as himself. When he speaks the other “him” looks at him like a child who cannot speak. <br><br>After a difficult conversation they both genuinely are relatively the same with the same goals. They know they were robbed of life, along with wishing to help their brother as he is left alone. <br><br>They both agreed to combine their strength and unify to get what they lost back.</span><p></p></div>\"",

Without proper parents and no sign of who their parents are. She was raised to be a church girl who was an awfully kind and peaceful soul.<br>She had always taken reading seriously, despite being in a church which follows Lord death, she takes it upon herself to learn about each and every god, demi-god to her best capabilities.<br>Within a small field that once was barren with dead grass and lifeless trees a Priestess had watched Lute tend to the barren land. Within a few months when the priestess decided to check on the barren land. She came across Lute dancing and singing with a field filled with flowers and fluorescent grass that glistens in the sunlight.<br><br></span><span class=\\\"c6 c7\\\">Chapter 2: Reverence in Motion<br><br></span><span class=\\\"c0\\\">Within the church, during one of the times of prayer, Lute has grown to be a sort of idol amongst not just the church but to the locals as this singer who isn&#39;t quite a priestess but also a wonderful singer whom people actually began to adore and showed up for church despite them only being there for the performances. <br><br>Most of the Priests and Priestess&rsquo;s did not like that the Church is being less used as a church and more like a stage. Whispers had long grown among the clergy that the faithful came for her voice more than the sermons.<br>They had planned something to poison Lute with her own flowers with some being poisonous, though during the scandal Lute had found out about it by overhearing.<br><br>Quietly within the night she prayed to Lord Death for forgiveness that she&rsquo;s leaving the church and to set out. Once packing her belongings along with her hand-crafted Lute that she made using one of the dead trees she used to make the beautiful garden, she sets out. Giving out a small Prayer to both Tryarha Mithso for good luck and Limia to help guide her throughout the night on her long walks.<br><br><br></span><span class=\\\"c7 c6\\\">Chapter 3: Petalwaltz<br><br></span><span class=\\\"c0\\\">Throughout her travels, she had come across the Intelegentsia guild, she was naturally talented with learning information. She in fact was Alarmingly talented with how magic works along with how the intricacies of how the weave works. Though was often side-tracked with her passion of creating music and poetry with constant prayers to different gods with various tasks she does.<br> <br>They however found uses for her, she can be used to travel and give Letters if magic was not an option. Though during one of the travels Lute found that there was one odd letter that she had rehearsed to remember as she always speaks the letter and burns it so nobody but her knows about what the letter said. It however left her disturbed with the Intelegentsia guild, she left in the middle of her mission from the guild as it went against her beliefs baring to knowledge of the letter. With this being the first letter that felt like a sin to speak aloud.<br><br>After she had left she pursued music where she found major success amongst the crowd even among dark times, she was a beacon that people looked to for happiness with her kind smile and positive outlook.<br><br>Though with the kindness of one&#39;s dance, there must be a contrasting force to even the brightest beacons right at their doorstep.<br><br></span><span class=\\\"c7 c6\\\">Chapter 4: One Who Walks a Half-Step Behind&mdash;and Asks Me to Dance </span></p><p class=\\\"c3 c4\\\"><span class=\\\"c0 c1\\\"></span></p><p class=\\\"c3\\\"><span class=\\\"c0\\\">During her trip to Orange Coral which was meant to be a show for many people to come and see. Within the show it had been going wonderfully, throughout the night sky there were lights going on with wondrous color. Though she had noticed there being more guards out than normal. Perhaps for her own protection, Security had been tightened after recent stalking attempts considering the popularity is the assumption she went under.<br>Though during her time on stage, tragedy struck with portals opening in the sky and monsters rained down. During the chaos that unfolded she prayed to </span><span class=\\\"c6 c0\\\">Barkakit</span><span class=\\\"c0\\\">&nbsp;to try and figure out what was going on. But before she could finish the prayer her shoulder was grabbed with a lady named </span><span class=\\\"c6 c0\\\">Ina</span><span class=\\\"c0\\\">&nbsp;telling her to move it and to get out of here. Lute seeing the people panicked and her wishing to help refused, with a determined look told her that &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t leave them behind&rdquo;<br><br>Ina seeing the look on Lute and not having the luxury of time folded as she said to help get as many civilians out. With the both working together managed to do so. Both talking along the way of their brief introductions, Ina was part of the crowds that she saw for her show. At one point they had to part ways with promises of potentially seeing each other again sometime, Lute leaving saw the chaos of what had happened, and vows to help as many individuals as she can without killing and redeem as many people as possible.<br><br></span><span class=\\\"c7 c6\\\">Chapter 5: Scattered Petals<br><br></span><span class=\\\"c1 c0\\\">In her sleep a memory is formed, though she cannot dream she felt like she had seen this before..she cannot see within whatever realm she&#39;s in, Feelings of flowers are on her eyes and her face, neck, even arms. She can feel like she is being held by something, either warm or cold with a voice speaking to her in sadness as she lays there weak. Without her knowledge she began speaking. &ldquo;______&hellip;wont..you..smile&hellip;For me?&rdquo;...sniffling can be heard from the male &ldquo;Lute&hellip;I..&rdquo; Her mouth would begin moving on her own again saying &ldquo;Please&hellip;Wont..Last&hellip;.Long&rdquo;<br><br>The male would compose themselves slowly as tears drip onto her face &ldquo;yeah.. I&rsquo;m smiling Sweetheart&hellip;Im..Smiling&rdquo;. Lute could feel her mouth open, muttering words that even she cannot understand. &ldquo;Hm..? Can you&hellip;Say that again..I didnt&hellip;Quite catch that&hellip;&rdquo;<br><br>&hellip;</span></p></body></html></div>\"",

Their daughter, Elyra Edenria, grew up among looms, dyed threads, and soft laughter.</span></p><p class=\\\"c0\\\"><span class=\\\"c2\\\">From her parents, Elyra learned not only how to weave cloth, but how to wait. Her mother often said, &ldquo;A good cloth isn&rsquo;t made by force. It listens.&rdquo; Elyra felt those words were about more than fabric. She noticed how one misplaced thread could change an entire pattern, and wondered if people shaped the world the</span></p><h1 class=\\\"c1\\\" id=\\\"h.txy170eye8kc\\\"><span class=\\\"c3\\\">Chapter II : The Pathstrider of Talia</span></h1><p class=\\\"c0\\\"><span class=\\\"c2\\\">Above their hearth rested a small shrine: a silver mirror framed in brass, dedicated to Talia, the Weaver of past, present, and future. Elyra prayed there often, questioning whether the Silent Goddess truly listened.</span></p><p class=\\\"c0\\\"><span class=\\\"c2\\\">At times, when the room was still, Elyra thought her reflection moved a moment too late, or smiled before she did. At first it frightened her. Over time, it became comforting.

Most villagers dismissed the stories.</span></p><p class=\\\"c0\\\"><span class=\\\"c2\\\">That night, as Elyra prayed, the candle flame bent sideways. In the mirror, her hands unraveled into light.

    "backstory": "\"Calen grew up watching both of his parents bring joy to everyone they met.  Whether it was his father saving the life of a member of the community or his mother putting on the most dazzling displays of wonder and magic that never failed to lift strangers out of the throes of despair.  All he wanted was to see people smile at him the way they smiled at his parents as for magical potential he had very little from a young age.  He tried to learn the art of music from his mother but other than an average singing voice he couldn't hope to catch up to her.  His father stepped in knowing Calen couldn't heal people magically the way he did, teaching his son anatomy and how to perform surgeries would do until his magic could support his efforts.<div><br></div><div>It would be a long road before Calen would be accepted into apprenticeship and begin cultivating a connection with the Goddess.  In the meantime he began spending most of his days studying textbooks and following his mother to her various shows watching dazzle crowds of strangers.  He got into the habit of trying to draw people in those moments of happiness, he would imagine the muscles at work beneath the skin, pictured the blood flowing rapidly as their hearts pumped harder.  He practiced drawing each system and got better and better at diagnosing potential problems by just looking at people.  On lucky occasions he would get to join his father and watch him as he worked and healed those that were struggling giving Calen valuable context for how sickness can affect different bodies.  There were many times that Vanessa would leave Calen alone to his studies as the in depth explanations Calen ranted about bored her to no end, one day she happened to leave her show sword behind.  What she had assumed would be out of reach for Calen was after some missed throws was easy enough for him to knock down from its perch high on the wall.  During one of his attempts to imitate a trick he had seen his mother perform hundreds of times he cut off two of his fingers.  When his parents returned together a short time later they returned to their son sat on the floor with dry tears streaking his face holding his fingers in his free hand and examining a cauterized wound carefully, they both panicked and put his hand back together, while the sword would have stay under a series of arcane locks when Vanessa wasn't wearing it.  The faded scars still linger on his left hand, barely visible unless closely examined.</div><div><br></div><div>When the time came to begin his apprenticeship he couldn't have been more excited and nervous.  He was the only candidate aiming to join as a healer at the time but that did not change the strict requirements he would have to meet.  After a stressful examination by Headmaster Wulfrum Calen was accepted and taken under the Wing of the Headmaster himself due to his extensive knowledge.  This put Calen on a fast track, he had unrestricted access to an enormous library, and an expert healer that helped  him develop his connection with the Goddess quicker than most.  He grew very close to the Headmaster and his father by getting the chance to work side by side with the both of them, this made his mother slightly jealous since Calen had less time to come to her shows.  She had a large event coming up that she begged both of them to attend to do something for once as a whole family, this was unfortunately interrupted by an emergency summons that took Cedric and the majority of the clergy away from the temple.  Calen after the show was instructed that he would be in charge of two trainees and the entire temple for an undetermined amount of time.  Over the next week Calen, Kilara, and Raegan would become fast friends.  In no time at all they learned to put complete trust in each other and grow together.  When everyone returned the Headmaster had passed away and was replaced by Headmistress Creed,  which was horrible news for the Hallowholm family.  Nerissa Creed for a very long time hated Cedric and Vanessa for reasons unknown to Calen and over time would slowly squeeze and pressure them until she revealed that the two had been stealing to support themselves.  Nerissa's solution was to use his parents as test subjects hide it from their son and send Calen away on the mission he is undertaking now.</div>\"",

    "main_personality": "Samudose is introspective and contemplative, driven by a deep desire to understand the arcane and unravel the mysteries surrounding his own existence. Though he harbors latent dark power, he maintains a neutral alignment, focusing on knowledge, self-mastery, and personal growth rather than domination or destruction. His role as a teacher at Astragrad provides a structured environment in which he can study his abilities while engaging with a diverse community of students and scholars. However, he possesses a critical flaw: he cannot keep a secret to save his life—or anyone else’s. He often speaks without fully considering his words, inadvertently revealing truths or delivering blunt remarks that can insult, offend, or complicate delicate situations.",
    "detailed_personality": [
      "Samudose is calm, gentle, and deeply attentive to the people around him. He listens more than he speaks and often pauses before acting, weighing the cost of his choices rather than the reward. He has an instinct to step forward when others are in pain, even if it means placing himself at risk.\n\nHe is kind without being naïve. Raised by farmers and protected by quiet compassion, he believes goodness is proven through action, not words. He avoids unnecessary conflict and prefers de-escalation, but when forced to act, he does so with steady resolve rather than anger.\n\nInternally, Samudose carries a constant, heavy awareness—an understanding of suffering that is not entirely his own. This makes him empathetic, but also distant at times. He struggles to ask for help and often believes he must endure hardship alone.\n\nDespite this, he is hopeful. He believes people can choose to be better, and that sacrifice should mean protection, not loss. His greatest strength is his willingness to carry weight without complaint—his most significant flaw is forgetting that he does not have to do so alone."

One arm reformed from charred rock and molten infernal blood, a volcanic weapon bound to wrath and memory. The other remained gone, a reminder that not all wounds are meant to be filled.  The volcanic arm now channels devastating power, but at a terrible cost: every time Samudose uses it, he sacrifices a fragment of memory or warmth from his former life."

This unique perception set her apart, admired by some but feared by many who mistook her introspection for something darker.</p>\\n<p data-start=\\\"1468\\\" data-end=\\\"1532\\\">So she learned silence.<br data-start=\\\"1491\\\" data-end=\\\"1494\\\">\\nNot out of shame, but out of patience.</p>\\n<h1><strong data-start=\\\"1537\\\" data-end=\\\"1578\\\">Chapter II: The Philosophy of Endings</strong></h1>\\n<p data-start=\\\"1580\\\" data-end=\\\"1880\\\">Zaelara grew into a quiet scholar of magic and technique. She trained tirelessly, blending the precision of weapon mastery with the elegance of arcane theory. Her hands were as skilled with a blade as they were with a spellbook, and her mind treated both disciplines as reflections of the same truth:</p>\\n<p data-start=\\\"1882\\\" data-end=\\\"1961\\\">All things—steel, magic, or people—carry points of tension where change begins.</p>\\n<p data-start=\\\"1963\\\" data-end=\\\"1996\\\">She often told her sister Bormey:</p>\\n<blockquote data-start=\\\"1998\\\" data-end=\\\"2068\\\">\\n<p data-start=\\\"2000\\\" data-end=\\\"2068\\\">“Every beginning is shaped by an ending.

Side by side, their talents mirrored and completed each other.</p>\\n<p data-start=\\\"1879\\\" data-end=\\\"1961\\\">Together they created their greatest treasure: <strong data-start=\\\"1926\\\" data-end=\\\"1938\\\">Samudose</strong>, their little brother.</p>\\n<h1><strong data-start=\\\"1966\\\" data-end=\\\"2004\\\">Chapter III: The Purpose She Chose</strong></h1>\\n<p data-start=\\\"2006\\\" data-end=\\\"2211\\\">Samudose became the anchor neither sister realized they needed.<br data-start=\\\"2069\\\" data-end=\\\"2072\\\">\\nHe softened Bormey’s edges, and in return, she taught him strength—not the strength to fight, but the strength to stand for what one loves.</p>\\n<p data-start=\\\"2213\\\" data-end=\\\"2269\\\">Bormey often lifted him onto her shoulders and told him:</p>\\n<blockquote data-start=\\\"2271\\\" data-end=\\\"2342\\\">\\n<p data-start=\\\"2273\\\" data-end=\\\"2342\\\">“The world is dangerous, little one. But you’re not facing it alone.”</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p data-start=\\\"2344\\\" data-end=\\\"2404\\\">Her love for him was fierce, boundless, and utterly sincere.</p>\\n<h1><strong data-start=\\\"2409\\\" data-end=\\\"2453\\\">Chapter IV: The Day Her World Went Still</strong></h1>\\n<p data-start=\\\"2455\\\" data-end=\\\"2610\\\">When Samudose was killed by a wandering Paladin driven by misguided righteousness, Bormey's scream echoed longer than any battle cry she had ever released.</p>\\n<p data-start=\\\"2612\\\" data-end=\\\"2670\\\">She didn’t rage.<br data-start=\\\"2628\\\" data-end=\\\"2631\\\">\\nShe didn’t destroy.<br data-start=\\\"2650\\\" data-end=\\\"2653\\\">\\nShe simply broke.</p>\\n<p data-start=\\\"2672\\\" data-end=\\\"2877\\\">The steady fire she once carried collapsed into embers she couldn’t control.

Her goal was simple:</p>\\n<p data-start=\\\"3236\\\" data-end=\\\"3286\\\"><strong data-start=\\\"3236\\\" data-end=\\\"3286\\\">Find the truth behind Samudose’s lost essence.</strong></p>\\n<p data-start=\\\"3288\\\" data-end=\\\"3497\\\">She fights only when necessary, using the mastery she earned through training, not divine blessing. She prefers to protect the small, the vulnerable, the overlooked—those Samudose himself would have cared for.</p>\\n<p data-start=\\\"3499\\\" data-end=\\\"3578\\\">But if champions of so-called justice try to hinder her, she does not hesitate.</p>\\n<blockquote data-start=\\\"3580\\\" data-end=\\\"3691\\\">\\n<p data-start=\\\"3582\\\" data-end=\\\"3691\\\">“I won’t let the world take another person I love,” she whispers whenever she tightens her grip on her blade.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p data-start=\\\"3693\\\" data-end=\\\"3761\\\">Her strength no longer comes from fury.<br data-start=\\\"3732\\\" data-end=\\\"3735\\\">\\nIt comes from <strong data-start=\\\"3749\\\" data-end=\\\"3760\\\">promise</strong>.</p>\\n<p data-start=\\\"3763\\\" data-end=\\\"3817\\\">A promise carved into her heart the day Samudose fell.</p>\"",

    "backstory": "\"<h1>Chapter I: The Earthshaker Farm</h1><p>Geoffrey Earthshaker was raised on a quiet farm where the soil was stubborn and the days were long. No one ever knew his true age. Some said he looked young. Others swore he had not changed in years. Geoffrey never corrected them. He only smiled.\\n<br>He was adopted by Ursina Earthshaker, a woman with strong hands and a stronger heart, and raised alongside his gentle sister, Belladonna. They taught him how to mend fences, carry hay, and listen to the land. Geoffrey loved them deeply—more than he ever learned how to say.\\n<br>The work kept him calm. The rhythm of planting and harvest quieted something fierce inside him. On the farm, his laughter came easily, and his temper slept.\\n<br>\\n</p><h1>Chapter II: The Gentle Weight of the Soil</h1><p>Geoffrey treated the land with care, as if it were alive, like people were. He spoke to stubborn soil, coaxed crops to grow, and carried heavy loads as if they were promises instead of burdens.</p><p>The villagers liked him. He was kind, helpful, and patient, always ready with a smile or a steady hand. Children followed him. Animals trusted him.</p><p>But when anger found him, the world noticed.</p><p>The ground trembled beneath his boots. Stones shifted. A faint, warm light traced his outline like a quiet halo. No one understood why—not Geoffrey, not the elders, not even Ursina.</p><p>“It's nothing,\\\" Geoffrey would say, embarrassed.<br>But the earth never agreed.</p><h1>Chapter III: The Rage Beneath the Kindness</h1><p>In battle, Geoffrey's fury was terrible.</p><p>When pushed too far, he became something ancient and loud, his strength shaking the field around him. Yet even then, there was no cruelty in him—only protection, only the need to end danger before it could hurt others.</p><p>When the fighting stopped, he was the first to kneel and help the wounded, enemy or friend. The glow faded. The ground grew still again.</p><p>Geoffrey never feared his rage.<br>He feared what it might mean.</p><h1>Chapter IV: Names That Linger Like Smoke</h1><p>There were nights when Geoffrey sat by the hearth, staring into the fire as if it were a doorway. Specific names came to him then:</p><p>Deirdre</p><p><span style=\\\"font-family: inherit;\\\">Rhaegar.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"font-family: inherit;\\\">Elenera.</span></p><p>Cassandra.</p><p>Friends from another road. Another life, perhaps. Their faces returned in the scent of rosemary, in the crackle of burning wood. He did not know where they were now, or if they still thought of him.</p><p>But his heart never let them go.</p><h1>Chapter V: The Reason He Walks</h1><p>Geoffrey loved the farm. He loved Ursina. He loved Belladonna.</p><p>But questions followed him like stars he could not look away from.</p><p>Who was he, truly?<br>Why did the earth answer his anger?<br>Why did the sky seem to watch him?</p><p>So one morning, Geoffrey set the plow aside. He hugged his mother and sister tightly and promised to return.</p><p>He now walks the roads guided by kindness and quiet strength—seeking old friends, chasing omens, and listening to the pull of something celestial etched deep within his soul.</p><p>Wherever he goes, compassion walks beside him, and he is going to help others no matter what.</p><p>And when needed, the earth itself answers his roar.</p>\"",

From a young age, he was taught stillness—how to breathe, how to listen, how to carry a spirit not wholly his own.</p><p>His elders spoke often of duty. Of the quori. Of the ancient war of dreams that never truly ended. Oranel listened, learned, and obeyed, but something within him never settled.</p><p>At night, when the halls were silent, he would sit awake and wonder if a life could belong to someone else and still be called free.</p><p>“Maybe I'm not broken,\\\" he once thought.<br>\\\"Maybe I'm just not meant for this.”</p><h1>Chapter II : The Monk Who Walked Away</h1><p>Oranel trained as a monk, mastering body and breath, motion and restraint. Yet with each year, the whispers of the quori grew heavier. Not louder—just closer. Always present. Always watching.</p><p>One morning, without ceremony or anger, Oranel left.</p><p>He did not curse his people.<br>He did not destroy shrines.<br>He simply walked beyond the Path of Light and never returned.</p><p>For years, he wandered. He became a guide—leading caravans through broken roads, escorting pilgrims through unsafe lands, helping the lost find passage where maps failed.</p><p>\\n</p><p>It was easier to give others direction than to choose one for himself.</p><h1>Chapter III : The One He Could Not Save</h1><p>There was a time when Oranel was trusted with a life that mattered deeply—whether to a family, a city, or a cause he never fully understood. He was chosen because he was calm. Because he was disciplined. Because people believed he would not fail.</p><p>But he did.</p><p>The night still returns to him in fragments. A road taken too late. A warning ignored. A single moment where hesitation outweighed action. By the time Oranel reached them, it was already over.</p><p>He knelt beside the body in silence, hands trembling despite years of training. No whispers guided him. No dream-voice warned him. The quori remained quiet.</p><p>“I was there,\\\" he thought.<br>\\\"And it still wasn't enough.”</p><p>In the days that followed, the weight of that failure pressed deeper than any command ever had. Duty could explain many things—but it could not undo what was lost.</p><p>It was then, in the hollow space left behind, that something answered his grief. Not with comfort, but with certainty. Power born of sacrifice. Strength shaped by pain.</p><p>Oranel did not pray.<br>He did not beg.</p><p>He accepted.</p><p>And from that moment on, he carried the knowledge that some paths are chosen not out of hope, but because there is no way back.</p><h1>Chapter IV: Dreams of Blood and Kin</h1><p>Though he rejected his heritage, Oranel could not escape his dreams.</p><p>He saw Lian, his niece in Astragrad, glowing softly like a fragile thread.<br>He saw Proi Kunaria, her sister, wrapped in shadow and fire—sometimes guarding, sometimes striking.</p><p>He woke unsure if these visions were warnings from the quori he left behind… or messages planted by the power he now served.</p><p>Either way, they reminded him that some ties never truly break.</p><h1>Chapter V: The Disciple in Crimson</h1><p>Years into his wandering, Oranel met a young Red Dragonborn—strong, reckless, and burning without direction. Where others saw danger, Oranel saw himself.</p><p>He took the Dragonborn in as a student.</p><p>For ten years, he taught discipline over destruction, thought over impulse. The Dragonborn learned restraint without losing his fire. In time, he came to see Oranel not just as a master but as family.</p><p>Then the Herschers of Arcane came.</p><p>They spoke of necessity. Of sacrifice. Of a mission meant to be final.</p>\"",

Her father <b>Victorio was the Spymaster of the Guild</b> he would often be out undercover or infiltrating the ranks and members of groups and organizations that the guild or himself would have interest in. Leaving Celeste in the care of a woman who in reality was Celeste's mother, or later on as she got older she'd spend her time with Javier a blacksmith at the guild who'd end up being the last remaining person Victorio could trust.</p><p>Though her family would have hoped for Celeste to have been able to have a normal life, the environment she grew up in nor her father's secrecy helped that situation. Celeste would go by the nicknames that people in the guild would call her, though thankfully enough it seemed like everyone around her was kind to her. Often spending time listening to the stories from people who've stopped by at the outpost or joining them in little hunting expeditions seemingly just to kill time. Though she understands now that it might not have been truly from the kindness of their hearts but more so possibly from fear of angering her father the unnamed spy master. Who due to what he did in his job was given the <b>nickname Death</b>.</p><h5 style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><i><u>Chapter 2: Hopeless faith against the fated</u></i></h5><p>All of this would change when she was around 9 years old when she'd run into one of her own betraying them. <b>Vautrin, one of two people her father trusted</b> and her would run into two fellow guild members. Though to Celeste, never being one who understood why her father went to such length to not hold trust in others hesitated... which would cost Vautrin his life. She's seen them drinking and laughing together so many times, all for it to seemingly mean nothing. <b>She had the opportunity</b> to stop them before they could have hurt her or him, <b>yet hesitation was all it took for them to strike Vautrin down</b>. Though in that, the shock fueled by pure rage and the combat prowess that her father had taught her allowed her to emerge victorious avenging Vautrin. <b>Severely injured nearly losing her right eye</b>, her father would rush back upon hearing the news. Celeste was then taken to see the hag her father once met, where she'd end up getting aid for the eye but couldn't have anything done about her fate.&nbsp;</p><p>When they returned <b>her father fell into a deeper obsession</b> with the whole premise. Never wanting to be a victim of circumstance again and wanting to possibly take action against her own fate, from this point onward <b>Celeste would focus on getting better in combat</b>. Wanting to follow in her father's footsteps so this wouldn't be a burden that he would continue to face on his own. Though it was at this point where her mother started heavily distancing herself from her and her father. With her change in character and motivation, she would finally <b>gain a nickname</b> by those around her that would end up sticking with her; <b>DD, Death's Daughter.</b></p><h5 style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><u><i>Chapter 3: The Calling</i></u></h5><p>Celeste's father would send letters back home to update his daughter on how he was doing. Though <b>the letter she received from his latest excursion deeply concerning to her</b>, and seemingly an omen of what was to come. The only thing she could make of it was how it seemed to come off as a warning that something was to come, and that it may have some involvement with <b>\\\"The Mark\\\"</b> that her father's mentioned for all these years. Putting the thought in her mind that <b>they might finally have found the answer they've been looking for.</b></p><p>Though up to that point nothing as bad as the incident years prior had occurred to her, she still had <b>trauma of her inaction causing the death of someone she cared about</b>. She showed the letter to her mother and Javier and voiced her concerns about wanting to figure out where her father headed. Javier headed to try to get intel on where Victorio's latest query, though the next morning when Celeste woke up she would find that <b>her mother was no where to be seen</b>. As telling as it could've been to make a connection with the warning in the letter, it made as much if not more sense to Celeste <b>that her mother used this as an opportunity to just get away from it all</b>. With Celeste now being completely alone, she swore to herself that she'd find her father.</p><p>While waiting for Javier to come back with the information, Celeste decided to spend some time settling her thoughts away from anyone but herself. During this trek she'd came upon a scene where a three headed dragon was being attacked seemingly defending a younger one of their kind. A feeling of connection, unity brought Celeste to come to its aid. When Celeste ran up to help it in the aftermath, there was a sudden flash of bright light, and a burning sensation on her left hand. A mark, one of which she's seen in her fathers scribbles from before, <b>The Mark of power</b>. In front of her where the dragon stood was now a <b>black stone</b> giving off a dull iridescent light. Knowing full well that if her father wasn't able to, she'd have less of a chance figuring out anything behind what just happened. She took it in stride now having a new companion at her side.</p><h5 style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><i><u>Chapter 4:</u></i></h5><p>Javier would later return bearing information about her father's ware bouts. Though concerned about the distinct change in Celeste she brushed it aside. The latest group that her father went out to investigate was the <b>Intelligentsia guild</b>. Though due to the secrecy of said guild information was hard to come by Javier found out that they were planning an expedition. Seeing this as her only chance, <b>Celeste and Javier used their connections to get her a spot on the boat</b>. Though Celeste tried to go under the Facade of just a kid trying to prove herself, trying her best to not possibly compromise herself if someone would know the involvement of her or her father and who they truly were.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\"",

Unlike his brother Tempore, His brother was far more talented at magic than him, along with more kindness. Despite being the weaker of the two he worked for everything with effort and ambition. Though he never resented his brother, in fact he cares deeply for his brother. The Vail itself had much to do and to train their very magical capabilities.<br>Tempus always, day and restless nights worked on practical methods as well as learning to hone his psionic magic effectively, stubborn as he was, ambition born fruit with him learning to use magic to his own whim, magic that he can call his own. Once he presented that he too can be like his brother, his brother smiled.<br><br></span></p><h1><span class=\\\"c0\\\">Chapter 2- Taijí of Silver</span></h1><span><br>As Both Brothers Spar, on the sidelines their mentor watches, Tempus loss after loss with frustration apparent with his brother being triumphant each time. Despite each loss though, his brother would always lend an open hand to his brother after the spar.<br>Tempus always felt humiliated, and despite him learning more about magic from his Mentor </span><span class=\\\"c1\\\">Ẕ̴͇͖̈́̂̌̅é̸̪̞̤͔̊̃̈́͂̆̚͠r̸̡̼̘͍̳̺̝̖̩̎͐̅͊̓o̸͔͇͕͈̞̱͓̱̟͓̊̍͒̑ͅ&nbsp;</span><span class=\\\"c2\\\">he would wonder what has been lacking. He understands that he is the weaker brother but his effort is worth more than what he believes.<br>Wanting answers, while his Mentor praises his brother and spends more time with him, Tempus goes off into the place his mentor spends most of his time. Amongst the items he finds files, papers that pique his curiosity raising new ideas that he didn’t figure was possible. Perhaps with those files and theories he can truly impress his mentor with the theory about Demi-planes he found Regarding an individual known as the \\\"First Herrscher\\\"<br><br></span><h1><span class=\\\"c0 c2\\\">Chapter 3- Yin &amp; Yang of Purple</span></h1><span class=\\\"c0 c2\\\"><br></span><span class=\\\"c2\\\">Upon a field with two big trees watching, Tempus creates a ritual circle with materials he had accumulated for this ritual to work. There had been some doubt that he would be capable of doing this, that he would fail as he always failed before. It had made sense, his brother the Golden child essentially of the two would always be praised for essentially doing nothing and Tempus more left on the sideline due to his “rebellious” nature. Casted those useless emotions aside, he began the ritual.<br><br>Half way through the ritual, he heard his Brothers and Mentor’s voice, one of worry and the other of almost anger. He was too far into the ritual to stop it now, but with both approaching tempus tries to stop their advances. During the scuffle something within the Ritual went wrong. It felt like the world itself was rupturing with a portal opening, clouds forming around the very area they find themselves in.<br><br>The portal pulls both him and his brother in with his mentor standing his ground. During the fall he had lost sight of his brother with whatever place he found himself in falling. Reaching out to grab anything at all, he saw Gold…Then Silver, Each time he reached but failed to grab hold of. When he thought hope was lost and realization set in that he has done something terrible; seeing something near the depth of whatever chasm he found himself in saw a purple shape.<br><br>He reached his hand out in one last attempt.</span><p></p></div>\"",

Without proper parents and no sign of who their parents are. She was raised to be a church girl who was an awfully kind and peaceful soul.<br><br>She had always taken reading seriously, despite being in a church which follows Lord death, she takes it upon herself to learn about each and every god, demi-god to her best capabilities.<br>Within a small field that once was barren with dead grass and lifeless trees a Priestess had watched Lute tend to the barren land. <br>Within a few months when the priestess decided to check on the barren land. She came across Lute dancing and singing with a field filled with flowers and fluorescent grass that glistens in the sunlight.<br><br></span><h1><span class=\\\"c0\\\">Chapter 2: Reverence in Motion</span></h1><span><br>In recent years, </span><span>Lute has grown to be a sort of idol amongst not just in the church but to the locals as this singer who isn't quite a priestess but also a wonderful singer whom people actually began to adore and showed up for church despite them only being there for the performances. <br><br>The Clergy began theorizing that Lute herself was using them for her own gain; Although Lute had not realized it at first, she carried on day to day life with brightness in her eyes.<br>Multiple attempts have been made to poison lute with her own flowers that she tends.<br>With more failures their attempts became more sloppy. With Lute eventually finding out after a series of attempts, decides it would be best to leave in the middle of the night.<br><br></span><h1><span class=\\\"c0\\\">Chapter 3: Petalwaltz</span></h1><span><br>During one of her lonesome performances in the forest, an unexpected Lady in the name of Iris appeared from the forest, having stopped briefly to hear such a performance. After Lutes performance she had finally noticed Iris, a little bewildered that someone would be this deep in the forest. After a brief conversation it appeared the two had gone along with Lute following Iris to a place called the \\\"Intelligentsia Guild”. <br><br>Thanks to Iris, Lute was able to temporarily get a job as a sort of messenger. The look on Lute’s Aloof face looked harmless enough, she was to be used to transport messages. However, after some time had passed she was tasked to give an envelope to someone, Lute would always read the Envelope and burn it so only she can remember and transfer the information more safely as she is clumsy with losing possessions.<br>Though the letter that she read was so shocking to her and haunting, she burnt the letter and left the guild during her mission.<br><br></span><h1><span class=\\\"c0\\\">Chapter 4: One Who Walks a Half-Step Behind—and Asks Me to Dance </span></h1><span><br>Lute had begun growing a career as a singer and dancer for the masses. One instance was when she went to Orange Coral for a party. Though security being tight, she had assumed it was for primarily her safety from Shady Individuals. <br><br>Tragedy struck when Portals began opening holes in the sky with Monsters raining down. Lute Initially panicked like the rest of the crowd seeing the disorder and not having the Agency attempt to pray, during her prayer she sees a lady named Ina who was taking control and leading crowds away from danger. She had almost instinctively followed Ina’s words; But realizing that her and Ina are similar but in different circumstances. <br>Lute had begun helping Ina with introductions set and a goal to help as many people as she can.<br><br></span><h1><span class=\\\"c0\\\">Chapter 5: Scattered Petals</span></h1><span class=\\\"c0\\\"><br></span><span class=\\\"c1\\\">In her sleep a memory is formed, though she cannot dream she felt like she had seen this before..she cannot see within whatever realm she's in, Feelings of flowers are on her eyes and her face, neck, even arms. She can feel like she is being held by something, either warm or cold with a voice speaking to her in sadness as she lays there weak. Without her knowledge she began speaking. “______…wont..you..smile…For me?”...sniffling can be heard from the male “Lute…I..” Her mouth would begin moving on her own again saying “Please…Wont..Last….Long”<br><br>The male would compose themselves slowly as tears drip onto her face “yeah.. I’m smiling Sweetheart…Im..Smiling”. Lute could feel her mouth open, muttering words that even she cannot understand. “Hm..? Can you…Say that again..I didnt…Quite catch that…”</span></p><p class=\\\"c4\\\"><span class=\\\"c1\\\"></span></p></div>\"",

Despite hesitation to serve the people who treated his father this way, he ended up carrying out tasks for the guild that suited his skillset.  Kavir was nimble in a crowd and his knowledge of alleyways and the sewer system made evading capture easy when stealing from targets he was assigned.  By day he honed his ability to disappear, while at night he would practice picking the series of locks between him and his father.  The guild quickly took note of this behavior but turned a blind eye and changed the locks frequently while increasing the difficulty of each to improve his skills silently.</span><p>Years later his father had passed away and Kavir took on the name Avarice and swore he would use the name to kill those that took his father from him.  He reached his breaking point soon after Devotion passed away, at which point he cut sawed off both of his horns and slipped out of the city in a caravan.  The next years challenged him to build a criminal reputation that could keep him fed while not alerting anyone that could recapture him of his location.  Sleep was out of reach for a very long time, his paranoia fueling him past most other peoples limits.  Eventually he had built a web of personas and names that he began to demonstrate his skills.  He quickly became a thorn in the Side of a particularly powerful and twisted individual, Herta took action quickly and became a sole provider of contracts for Avarice.  He worked his way up the ranks, nearly joining the infamous ghost squadron.&nbsp; When the organization he served began falling apart he cut ties and ran away with his last assignment, ordered to keep her safe.&nbsp;<br></p>\"",

Ever since at a young age, he has had the gift of a strong, healthy body along with the gift of ever growing magic that in raw power was unmatched, though he never used it for wrong-doing. He used it as a source to nurture those that need help. <br>Unlike his brother Tempus who is not as gifted in him, he would always praise his own brother for his thinking, In fact he could even say he envied his strong resolve on wanting to grow and not be complacent.<br>He would have been content to be the way that he is, but seeing such will from his brother, it made him also want to grow as a person himself.<br><br></span><h1><span class=\\\"c1\\\">Chapter 2: Moment of Division</span></h1><span class=\\\"c1\\\"><br></span><span>Sounds of spells can be heard being casted. “Again.” was said by the Brother’s Mentor Ẕ̴͇͖̈́̂̌̅é̸̪̞̤͔̊̃̈́͂̆̚͠r̸̡̼̘͍̳̺̝̖̩̎͐̅͊̓o̸͔͇͕͈̞̱͓̱̟͓̊̍͒̑ͅ.<br>Tempore doesn’t quite understand as to why this person stayed with the two brothers with the claim that they had much potential. In fact, it bothered him that he was more praised for his natural talent compared to his brother's pure effort. <br>Though he never disliked it, In fact he actually quite enjoyed it, he saw their mentor as a sort of father figure. Seemed to always support what he does with a guiding hand. <br>He had even taken cooking which he was excellent at, though he was told to not do it often as it “Neglected training”. What kind of training except teaching him things about the outside world, as well as using Magic to harm others; even his own brother when they spar. With a heavy heart does so but always prefers to heal than to harm.<br><br></span><h1><span class=\\\"c1 c3\\\">Chapter 3: Dynamic Balance</span></h1></p><p class=\\\"c0\\\"><span>Tempore began flying as fast as he could. He was told by his mentor that his brother, his only family, began doing something reckless. He was attempting to open a portal, he never quite understood the details at the time as he was more worried about his brother. Doubt came to him if he had been neglecting his own brother too much, maybe jealousy came to Tempus that caused him to do what he’s doing.<br>The moment both intercepted his brother, they had successfully disrupted the ritual that he had been making. Though, one moment he saw a portal open. Everything around them began falling apart like shards crumbling, he was pulled into the portal along with his brother leaving their mentor behind.<br>As he was falling, he tried his best to reach out to his brother, but a sudden gap opened where he began falling down, and ended up in a newfound place unknown </span><span>to him</span><span>.<br>Stranded and alone he </span><span>wonders to find where</span><span class=\\\"c2\\\">&nbsp;his brother went; along with regaining contact with his mentor and to help him right whatever wrong his brother could have potentially done.</span></p></div>\"",
